## 🎯 Your Unique Selling Points

### 1. **Runway-First**
Every screen, every metric screams "HOW LONG CAN YOU SURVIVE?"
MYSA shows generic accounting. You show survival metrics.

### 2. **Predictive, Not Reactive**
"You'll run out in 3 months" vs MYSA's "You spent X last month"

### 3. **Fundraising Tools**
Model dilution, track cap table, scenario planning.
MYSA has ZERO fundraising features.

### 4. **Natural Language AI**
"How much on SaaS?" gets instant answers.
MYSA requires clicking through reports.

### 5. **Startup-Specific Benchmarks**
"You're burning 25% more than similar startups"
MYSA can't do this.

### 6. **Investor Transparency**
One-click read-only dashboards for VCs.
MYSA forces manual report exports.

### 7. **Build in Public**
Optional public dashboards for transparency.
MYSA doesn't support this.

### 8. **Viral Growth**
Built-in referral program.
MYSA relies on paid marketing.
